# Langchain-Start
**Introduction**

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that:

**Are context-aware**: connect a language model to sources of context (prompt instructions, few shot examples, content to ground its response in, etc.)

**Reason**: rely on a language model to reason (about how to answer based on provided context, what actions to take, etc.)

This framework consists of several parts:

**LangChain Libraries**: The Python and JavaScript libraries. Contains interfaces and integrations for a myriad of components, a basic run time for combining these components into chains and agents, and off-the-shelf implementations of chains and agents.

**LangChain Templates**: A collection of easily deployable reference architectures for a wide variety of tasks.

**LangServe**: A library for deploying LangChain chains as a REST API.

**LangSmith:** A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor chains built on any LLM framework and seamlessly integrates with LangChain.
